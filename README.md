Raspberry Pi P10 Panel Controller
This app is designed to manage a Raspberry Pi P10 panel. It allows you to set up a scoreboard and create custom displays by combining videos, images, text, and audio into unique tracks. These tracks are then sent to the Raspberry Pi for display.

The app dynamically retrieves the server URL generated by the Raspberry Pi (using ngrok) and stored in a pre-configured Firebase database. It pings the server to confirm the panel is online before sending data.

Features
Scoreboard Management: Configure and update scores for games and events.
Custom Display Maker: Create and manage tracks with videos, images, text, and audio.
Dynamic Server Connection: Automatically fetches the Raspberry Pi's server URL and verifies its status.
Data Transfer: Seamlessly sends tracks and scoreboard updates to the Raspberry Pi.
Compatibility

Windows for development and testing.
Android for running the app on mobile devices.
iOS Deployment: Requires a MacBook to build, test, and deploy the app.

How It Works
The Raspberry Pi generates a server URL using ngrok and automatically uploads it to a pre-configured Firebase database.
The app retrieves the server URL from Firebase and pings it to check if the Raspberry Pi is online.
You can:
Set up and update a scoreboard.
Create and send custom tracks with videos, images, text, and audio.
The app sends all configured data to the Raspberry Pi for display on the P10 panel.
Requirements
Flutter SDK
Android Studio with Flutter and Dart plugins
A MacBook (for iOS development and deployment)
