# **Raspberry Pi P10 Panel Controller**

This app is designed to manage a Raspberry Pi P10 panel. It enables you to set up a **scoreboard** and create **custom displays** by combining videos, images, text, and audio into unique tracks. These tracks are sent to the Raspberry Pi for display.

The app dynamically retrieves the server URL generated by the Raspberry Pi (using ngrok) and stored in a pre-configured Firebase database. It pings the server to confirm the panel is online before sending data.
